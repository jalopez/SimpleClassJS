SimpleClassJS
=============
A lightweight JavaScript Class framework

Purpose
-------
The purpose of this framework is to be lightweight and clean, but offering
full OO support, including subclassing, inheritance and so.
There are better class JS frameworks out there, but this is an exercise to
see if I can make something simple but powerful enough for a real app.

Usage
-----
There is not any implementation yet!
